The Mesh compiler and runtime make use of the following open-source libraries:

The Mesh compiler uses a parser generated by the Rats! parser generator, part of 
the [xtc](http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/xtc/) eXTensible Compiler project. The generated 
parser makes use of the Rats runtime library, which is distributed under the LGPL;
the rest of the XTC project is distributed under the GPL license, as described on 
the project's homepage.

Both the Mesh compiler and runtime use [Guava](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/),
which is distributed under the Apache 2.0 License, as described on the project homepage.

The Mesh compiler uses the [Javassist](http://www.jboss.org/javassist) library for
bytecode generation. Javassist is distributed under the Apache License (among others).

The Mesh runtime libraries currently include foreign-function bindings to the
[Processing](http://processing.org) image rendering and animation Java library,
which is distributed under the LGPL, as described on the Processing project's 
homepage.

The Mesh interactive shell uses the [JLine](http://jline.sourceforge.net/)
library for terminal emulation. JLine is distributed under the BSD license.
